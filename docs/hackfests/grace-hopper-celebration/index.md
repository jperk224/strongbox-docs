# Grace Hopper Celebration Opensource Day

In continuation of our involvement in previous hackfests, such as [#Hacktoberfest], we have been invited to participate
in the [Grace Hopper Celebration 2020 Opensource Day][Grace Hopper Celebration: Opensource Day]. We are thrilled to be
taking part in such a fantastic event that promotes diversity and inclusion and tries to get more women involved in the
software industry! 

## About The Event

The Grace Hopper Celebration: Opensource Day is a one-day event that usually takes place around the end of September
and beginning of October.

### Who Was Grace Hopper?

According to Wikipedia.org:

> Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and
> United States Navy rear admiral.[1] One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of
> computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. She popularized the idea of machine-independent
> programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in
> use today.

### What is AnitaB.org?

According to Wikipedia.org:

>AnitaB.org (formerly Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, and Institute for Women in Technology) is a global
non-profit organization based in Belmont, California. Founded by computer scientists [Anita Borg] and Telle Whitney,
the institute's primary aim is to recruit, retain, and advance women in technology.
>
> The institute's most prominent program is the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference, the world's
largest gathering of women in computing. From 2002 to 2017, AnitaB.org was led by Telle Whitney, who co-founded the
